      "content_full": "Story text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nDiscord is facing backlash after\nannouncing\nthat all users will soon be required to verify ages to access adult content by sharing video selfies or uploading government IDs.\nAccording to Discord, it’s relying on AI technology that verifies age on the user’s device, either by evaluating a user’s facial structure or by comparing a selfie to a government ID. Although government IDs will be checked off-device, the selfie data will never leave the user’s device, Discord emphasized. Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user’s age is estimated.\nIn a blog, Discord confirmed that “a phased global rollout” would begin in “early March,” at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate” experiences.\nTo unblur sensitive media or access age-restricted channels, the majority of users will likely have to undergo Discord’s age estimation process. Most users will only need to verify their ages once, Discord said, but some users “may be asked to use multiple methods, if more information is needed to assign an age group,” the blog said.\nOn social media, alarmed Discord users protested the move, doubting whether Discord could be trusted with their most sensitive information after\nDiscord age verification data was recently breached\n. In October, hackers stole government IDs of 70,000 Discord users from a third-party service that Discord previously trusted to verify ages in the United Kingdom and Australia.\nAt that time, Discord\ntold users\nthat the hackers were hoping to use the stolen data to “extort a financial ransom from Discord.” In October, Ars Senior Security Editor Dan Goodin joined others warning that “the best advice for people who have submitted IDs to Discord or any other service is to assume they have been or soon will be stolen by hackers and put up for sale or used in extortion scams.”\nFor bad actors, Discord will likely only become a bigger target as more sensitive information is collected worldwide, users now fear.\nIt’s no surprise then that hundreds of Discord users on Reddit slammed the decision to expand age verification globally shortly after\nThe Verge broke the news\n. On a\nPC gaming subreddit\ndiscussing alternative apps for gamers, one user wrote, “Hell, Discord has already had one ID breach, why the fuck would anyone verify on it after that?”\n“This is how Discord dies,” another user declared. “Seriously, uploading any kind of government ID to a 3rd party company is just asking for identity theft on a global scale.”\nMany users seem just as sketched out about sharing face scans. On the\nDiscord app subreddit\n, some users vowed to never submit selfies or IDs, fearing that breaches may be inevitable and suspecting Discord of downplaying privacy risks while allowing data harvesting.\nWho can access Discord age-check data?\nDiscord’s system is supposed to make sure that only users have access to their age-check data, which Discord said would never leave their phones.\nThe company is hoping to convince users that it has tightened security after the breach by partnering with k-ID, an increasingly popular age-check service provider that’s also used by social platforms from Meta and Snap.\nHowever, self-described Discord users on Reddit aren’t so sure, with some going the extra step of picking apart k-ID’s privacy policy to understand exactly how age is verified without data ever leaving the device.\n“The wording is pretty unclear and inconsistent even if you dig down to the k-ID privacy policy,” one Redditor\nspeculated\n. “Seems that ID scans are uploaded to k-ID servers, they delete them, but they also mention using ‘trusted 3rd parties’ for verification, who may or may not delete it.” That user seemingly gave up on finding reassurances in either company’s privacy policies, noting that “everywhere along the chain it reads like ‘we don’t collect your data, we forward it to someone else… .’”\nTo better understand user concerns, Ars reviewed the privacy policies, noting that k-ID said its “facial age estimation” tool is provided by a Swiss company called Privately.\n“We don’t actually see any faces that are processed via this solution,” k-ID’s policy said.\nThat part does seem vague, since Privately isn’t explicitly included in the “we” in that statement. Similarly, further down, the policy more clearly states that “neither k-ID nor its service providers collect any biometric information from users when they interact with the solution. k-ID only receives and stores the outcome of the age check process.” In that section, “service providers” seems to refer to partners like Discord, which integrate k-ID’s age checks, rather than third parties like Privately that actually conduct the age check.\nAsked for comment, a k-ID spokesperson told Ars that “the Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on the user’s device in real time when they are performing the verification. That means there is no video or image transmitted, and the estimation happens locally. The only data to leave the device is a pass/fail of the age threshold which is what Discord receives (and some performance metrics that contain no personal data).”\nK-ID’s spokesperson told Ars that no third parties store personal data shared during age checks.\n“k-ID, does not receive personal data from Discord when performing age-assurance,” k-ID’s spokesperson said. “This is an intentional design choice grounded in data protection and data minimisation principles. There is no storage of personal data by k-ID or any third parties, regardless of the age assurance method used.”\nTurning to Privately’s website, that offers a little\nmore information\non how on-device age estimation works, while providing likely more reassurances that data won’t leave devices.\nPrivately’s services were designed to minimize data collection and prioritize anonymity to comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, Privately\nnoted\n. “No user biometric or personal data is captured or transmitted,” Privately’s website said, while bragging that “our secret sauce is our ability to run very performant models on the user device or user browser to implement a privacy-centric solution.”\nThe company’s\nprivacy policy\noffers slightly more detail, noting that the company avoids relying on the cloud while running AI models on local devices.\n“Our technology is built using on-device edge-AI that facilitates data minimization so as to maximise user privacy and data protection,” the privacy policy said. “The machine learning based technology that we use (for age estimation and safeguarding) processes user’s data on their own devices, thereby avoiding the need for us or for our partners to export user’s personal data onto any form of cloud services.”\nAdditionally, the policy said, “our technology solutions are built to operate mostly on user devices and to avoid sending any of the user’s personal data to any form of cloud service. For this we use specially adapted machine learning models that can be either deployed or downloaded on the user’s device. This avoids the need to transmit and retain user data outside the user device in order to provide the service.”\nFinally, Privately explained that it also employs a “double blind” implementation to avoid knowing the origin of age estimation requests. That supposedly ensures that Privately only knows the result of age checks and cannot connect the result to a user on a specific platform.\nAsked for comment, Discord’s spokesperson said that “\nDiscord and our age assurance vendor partners do not permanently store personal identity documents or users’ video selfies. Identity documents, including selfies, are deleted once a user’s age group is confirmed, and the selfie video used for facial age estimation never leaves their device.”\n“We’re also exploring other vendors and will be transparent with users if the data practices for vendors differ,” Discord’s spokesperson said. “We’ll continue to put user privacy first as we consider introducing any additional methods in the future. We also frequently audit our third-party systems to ensure they meet our security and privacy standards.”\nDiscord expects to lose users\nSome Discord users may never be asked to verify their ages, even if they try to access age-restricted content. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, told The Verge that Discord “is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata, like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.”\n“If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich said.\nBadalich confirmed that Discord is bracing for some users to leave Discord over the update but suggested that “we’ll find other ways to bring users back.”\nOn Reddit, Discord users complained that age verification is easy to bypass, forcing adults to share sensitive information without keeping kids away from harmful content. In Australia, where Discord’s policy first rolled out, some kids\nclaimed\nthat Discord never even tried to estimate their ages, while others found it easy to trick k-ID by using AI videos or altering their appearances to look older. A teen girl relied on fake eyelashes to do the trick, while one 13-year-old boy was estimated to be over 30 years old after scrunching his face to seem more wrinkled.\nBadalich told The Verge that Discord doesn’t expect the tools to work perfectly but acts quickly to block workarounds, like\nteens using\nDeath Stranding\n‘s photo mode\nto skirt age gates. However, questions remain about the accuracy of Discord’s age estimation model in assessing minors’ ages, in particular.\nIt may be noteworthy that Privately only claims that its technology is “proven to be accurate to within 1.3 years, for 18-20-year-old faces, regardless of a customer’s gender or ethnicity.” But experts told Ars last year that\nflawed age-verification technology\nstill frequently struggles to distinguish minors from adults, especially when differentiating between a 17- and 18-year-old, for example.\nPerhaps notably, Discord’s prior scandal occurred after hackers stole government IDs that users shared as part of the appeal process in order to fix an incorrect age estimation. Appeals could remain the most vulnerable part of this process, The Verge’s report indicated. Badalich confirmed that a third-party vendor would be reviewing appeals, with the only reassurance for users seemingly that IDs shared during appeals “are deleted quickly\n—\nin most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”\nOn Reddit, Discord fans awaiting big changes remain upset. A disgruntled Discord user\nsuggested\nthat “corporations like Facebook and Discord, will implement easily passable, cheapest possible, bare minimum under the law verification, to cover their ass from a lawsuit,” while forcing users to trust that their age-check data is secure.\nAnother user joked that she’d be more willing to trust that selfies never leave a user’s device if Discord were “willing to pay millions to every user” whose “scan does leave a device.”\nThis story was updated on February 9 to add comments from Discord and k-ID, and to clarify that government IDs are checked off-device.\nAshley Belanger\nSenior Policy Reporter\nAshley Belanger\nSenior Policy Reporter\nAshley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.

Most games see a typical eye-drying 18 commercial breaks.\nOne commercial that has struck a nerve with the public promotes\nAmazon’s Ring Doorbell\n. Although the storyline is intended to be heartwarming, it has been branded by viewers as ‘terrifying’.\nA Ring Doorbell is a video doorbell that lets homeowners see, hear, and speak to visitors at your door (such as delivery drivers, for example) from anywhere just by using your\nphone\nthanks to a built-in HD camera, microphone and speaker.\nAdvert\nIt allows for two-way conversations and remote monitoring to take place, enhancing\nhome\nsecurity and convenience (just in case you miss a delivery).\nThe new commercial promotes a new technological feature for the doorbell, and the ad explains how it works by addressing the missing\npets\ncrisis in the US.\nA staggering 10 million animals go missing every year, the melodramatic ad explains.\n\"And the way we look for them hasn't changed in years,\" the voice of Jamie Siminoff, founder of Ring, narrates.\nThe solution to find these lost fur babies? A new Ring feature that lets pet owners upload an image of their lost dog or cat to the Ring app, which then starts a 'Search Party'.\nThis search sweeps through all Ring cameras in the neighbourhood looking for a match, as the ad explains: \"Search Party from Ring uses\nAI\nto help families find lost dogs.\"\nAnd that’s not all - the new feature is already in the works, with the ad claiming 'since launch, more than a dog a day has been reunited with their family'.\nThe Ring Doorbell ad sheds light on the missing pets crisis (Ring Doorbell)\nThe commercial concludes: \"Be a hero in your neighbourhood with Search Party. Available to everyone, for free, right now.\"\nAccording to\nAmazon News\n, Ring is also giving $1 million to more than 4,000 US shelters to help them use Search Party to reunite lost pets with their owners.\nHowever, some social media users have been left 'creeped' out by the ad.\nOne\nX\nuser wrote: “Ring just aired a commercial that said they’ll hack into ya camera if a dog is lost??”\nAnother person chimed in and said: “The Ring Ad was awfully dystopian. ‘Let’s trick the public into allowing us free reign of their home security cameras by using lost puppies’. What could possibly go wrong?”\nRing Doorbells are meant to add another layer of security and convenience to your home (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)\nA third person shared their thoughts on social media, writing: “That Ring ad will cause me to uninstall Ring.”\nWhile a fourth shared: “I know that ring.com commercial about finding lost pets was supposed to be cute and heartwarming but the prospect of mass surveillance and human tracking should be alarming as f*ck.”\nTyla has contacted Amazon's Ring for comment.\nFeatured Image Credit: Ring Doorbell\nTopics:\nAmazon\n,\nTechnology\n,\nHome\nThe Tyla Team",

Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI.\nDiscord\nannounced on Monday\nthat it’s rolling out age verification on its platform globally starting next month, when it will automatically set all users’ accounts to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless they demonstrate that they’re adults.\n“For most adults, age verification won’t be required, as Discord’s age inference model uses account information such as account tenure, device and activity data, and aggregated, high-level patterns across Discord communities. Discord does not use private messages or any message content in this process,” Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, tells\nThe Verge\n.\nUsers who aren’t verified as adults will not be able to access age-restricted servers and channels, won’t be able to speak in Discord’s\nlivestream-like “stage” channels\n, and will see content filters for any content Discord detects as graphic or sensitive. They will also get warning prompts for friend requests from potentially unfamiliar users, and DMs from unfamiliar users will be automatically filtered into a separate inbox.\nRelated\nWelcome to the ‘papers, please’ internet\nReady or not, age verification is rolling out across the internet\nA nationwide internet age verification plan is sweeping Congress\nDirect messages and servers that are not age-restricted will continue to function normally, but users won’t be able to send messages or view content in an age-restricted server until they complete the age check process, even if it’s a server they were part of before age verification rolled out. Badalich says those servers will be “obfuscated” with a black screen until the user verifies they’re an adult. Users also won’t be able to join any new age-restricted servers without verifying their age.\n1\n/\n2\nUnverified users won’t be able to enter age-restricted servers.\nImage: Discord\nDiscord’s global age verification launch is part of\na wave of similar moves\nat other online platforms, driven by an international legal push for age checks and stronger child safety measures. This is not the first time Discord has implemented some form of age verification, either. It initially rolled out age checks for users\nin the UK and Australia\nlast year, which some users figured out how to circumvent\nusing\nDeath Stranding\n’s photo mode\n. Badalich says Discord “immediately fixed it after a week,” but expects users will continue finding creative ways to try getting around the age checks, adding that Discord will “try to bug bash as much as we possibly can.”\nIt’s not just teens trying to cheat the system who might attempt to dodge age checks. Adult users could avoid verifying, as well, due to concerns around data privacy, particularly if they don’t want to use an ID to verify their age. In October, one of Discord’s former third-party vendors\nsuffered a data breach\nthat exposed users’ age verification data, including images of government IDs.\nIf Discord’s age inference model can’t determine a user’s age, a government ID might still be required for age verification in its global rollout. According to Discord, to remove the new “teen-by-default” changes and limitations, “users can choose to use facial age estimation or submit a form of identification to [Discord’s] vendor partners, with more options coming in the future.”\nThe first option uses AI to analyze a user’s video selfie, which Discord says never leaves the user’s device. If the age group estimate (teen or adult) from the selfie is incorrect, users can appeal it or verify with a photo of an identity document instead. That document will be verified by a third party vendor, but Discord says the images of those documents “are deleted quickly — in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”\nUsers can view and update their age group from their profile.\nImage: Discord\nBadalich also says after the October data breach, Discord “immediately stopped doing any sort of age verification flows with that vendor” and is now using a different third-party vendor. She adds, “We’re not doing biometric scanning [or] facial recognition. We’re doing facial estimation. The ID is immediately deleted. We do not keep any information around like your name, the city that you live in, if you used a birth certificate or something else, any of that information.”\n“A majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”\nBadalich goes on to explain that the addition of age assurance will mainly impact adult content: “A majority of people on Discord are not necessarily looking at explicit or graphic content. When we say that, we’re really talking about things that are truly adult content [and] age inappropriate for a teen. So, the way that it will work is a majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”\nEven so, there’s still a risk that some users will leave Discord as a result of the age verification rollout. “We do expect that there will be some sort of hit there, and we are incorporating that into what our planning looks like,” Badalich says. “We’ll find other ways to bring users back.”\nCorrection, January 9th:\nRemoved note about the types of metadata Discord’s inference model uses and added quote from Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy\n,\nclarifying the use of the inference model.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nStevie Bonifield\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nDiscord will require a face scan or ID for full access next month\nThis whistle fights fascists\nAI-generated ads dropped the ball at this year’s Super Bowl\nApple is killing the old HomeKit tomorrow\nNetflix’s Warner Bros. merger puts rival streamers in survival mode\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

Or perhaps your software coding is going slower than you always thought it would?\nMost of all, does your kid struggle with not being able to imagine the decor of his bedroom in your new home?\nIf any of these problems resonate — and really, what could be more universal? — has Silicon Valley got an\nAI\nproduct for you.\nYou may have noticed Sunday night that these four instances were prime AI use cases per a series of\nSuper Bowl\nads from the industry’s biggest players (\nMicrosoft\nCopilot, unicorn startup GenSpark,\nOpenAI\n‘s Codex and\nGoogle\nGemini, respectively), either solving challenges that don’t exist day-to-day for most Americans or, in the last case, solving a challenge that may actually be\na good thing\n. Any parenting expert will tell you that temporary uncertainty or disappointment can healthily prepare a child for adulthood. But why risk that brief bout of questioning when AI can Magic Erase it from their lives?\nOf course, we’re acting like the removal of a childhood-development moment is a byproduct of AI adoption and not the whole point. While these ads and the dozen or so more that aired during the game— from both established players like Meta and\nAnthropic\nand upstarts like Ramp AI and Artlist — have different visions for how machine thinking will help us, they are nearly all united by a common ideology. Namely: Everyday life is unruly, unknown,\nhard\n. Wouldn’t it be nice if a computer happened along to make it easy and guaranteed?\nIf you arrived unformed into the techno-capitalist parade that is the current iteration of the Super Bowl telecast, you would come to at least one very specific conclusion: technology will soon offload so much of our current toil. “It’ll be whatever we want it to be,” the Gemini mother\nsays to her son\nabout their house — AI is apparently manna now — as onscreen a message flashes “A new kind of help from Google.” A more encapsulating set of credos I cannot imagine. Whatever we want! No limitations or consequences! And new help! Who doesn’t want that? Well, compared to the current kind of Googling — the kind that requires critical thinking — it certainly is new. Better? Less clear.\nTech revolutions at heart change the mechanisms by which humans live. The automobile lessened our reliance on the horse. This new revolution will lessen our need for a brain. Whether we want what this digital Che will wreak is another matter. Yes, on the surface, this ad spate is about AI products, which is about massive capitalizations, and Wall Street valuations, and many other -ations you hear on CNBC. But such talk of companies and products abstract, purposefully, what’s really being sold.\nThe abstracting reached its pinnacle (nadir) with an insidious Alexa ad featuring Chris Hemsworth and wife Elsa Pataky. He\ninsisted\nthe smart speaker could go sentient in various wildly extravagant ways and kill him — a classic straw man of painting anyone worried about AI Safety as some kind of tinfoil alarmist while cleverly ignoring the actual dangers, like Alexa’s\nnew policy of nonconsensual constant uploading\n. (See also under\nAmazon\n‘s Super Bowl Ring ad for how it\nsaves all the lost dogs\nwhile, oh yes, turning on some kind of Big Brother camera for mass surveillance.)\n“I would never. I’m just here to help,” Alexa tells Hemsworth, which confoundingly seeks to have it both ways: “An AI can’t have murderous feelings; that’s silly. But it can have feelings of help and love!” (Literally\nan Alexa ad from earlier this football season\nstarring Pete Davidson has him vulnerably telling a computer screen “I like you, too.”)\nTo think about any of these tech company ads for more than five seconds is to realize how little they stand up to scrutiny. Which is exactly how the brands want it generally: feeling more, thinking less.\nOf course matters aren’t that simple; we’re just not that naive anymore. By now too many of us are wary of what’s being sold — sensitized by two years of deepfakes and soft slop, chastened by two decades of social media and rage-farming. And indeed, in-between the shiny sales pitches came little glimpses of self-own. Anthropic went after OpenAI for how the latter’s ad-based chatbot could be compromised without appearing to realize that asking sensitive information from a chatbot could be dangerous even when it wasn’t trying to sell you something. I’m not sure relying on an LLM to tell you\nhow to navigate your relationship with your mother\nis so wise even if it refrains from pushing a cougar dating site.\nAnd Artlist.io, a little-known video-generation platform, pitched its tools to NY and LA markets\nwith an ad\nthe company told us that as a result of those tools took less than a week to create — or rather, a polar bear reading a voiceover script told us that while, on screen, dogs roasted marshmallows, horses ate from craft services and a person in a banana costume surveyed a rocker-destroyed stage, all in an attempt to show how our content landscape will be transformed.\nRelated Stories\nMusic\nLady Gaga and Ricky Martin Are in Their Feels After Performing During Bad Bunny's Halftime Show: \"I Am So Humbled\"\nMusic\nMarc Anthony on Puerto Rican Pride and His First Vegas Residency\n“Artlist’s Big Game debut proves that high-end video production is no longer gated by time, budget, or access,” an accompanying press release touted. No doubt such efficiency-boasts land with Madison Avenue beancounters, but the rest of us may find ourselves busy trying to recover from the retinal burning brought on by these proto-assaults of slop. Some 25 million people viewed the spot, by the way, but only 15 commented on it, and most were critical. These ads may not have fooled as many of us as their makers seemed to think.\nSome brands, at least, respected human intelligence. One standout came from Volkswagen — which went back to its “90’s “Drivers Wanted” slogan and the deeply human vibes of its\nseminal Nick Drake spot\nfrom that era (directed by a pre\nLittle Miss Sunshine\nJonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris!) — with a\nbeautifully on-point third-quarter ad\n. Soundtracked by House of Pain’s 90’s staple “Jump Around,” the spot showed a young professional guy leaving his laptop life behind to play with his dog; a Gen Z woman dancing in the rain and getting her friends to exit the car to join her; a driver making a U-turn to follow an ice cream truck; and a group in a schoolyard cheering on a besuited corporate worker to kick back their soccer ball over the fence, Messi penalty-kick style, which he eventually does, incurring sweet release.\nHardly a smartphone appears in the spot, let alone any AI,  and the whole vibe blissfully shrugs its shoulders at the “let a computer tell you what to do” low-key enslavement of so many of the other spots that aired Sunday night (and at the slop; it was shot on film).\n“Being so programmed puts us in handcuffs, and we wanted to push back on that,” Rachel Zaluzec, Volkswagen’s chief marketing officer, told me in an interview Friday. The company didn’t even set out to make a Super Bowl ad, she said; it simply wanted to react to all the automation out there before soon realizing that it had a newly relevant “Drivers Wanted” campaign capturing the essence of those refreshing pre-tech days.\n“We see this as a recruiting campaign for an invitation to participate,” she said. “All this tech has its place of course but we should be asking, ‘are we controlling it or is it controlling us?'” Even driving, she added, could be a human act compared to the shut-offery of our Uberized and Waymoified world. “There’s nothing like putting your hands on the wheel and deciding where you want to go,” she said.\nOne of the slop-makers was trying to temper their message, too. Beverage company Sazerac, which during the game had\nthe first-ever\nnational Super Bowl ad generated by AI, said that i\nts revival of the Fembot and Brobot characters\nto sell Svedka vodka was meant to show the folly of turning over so much power to the algorithm. “The entire idea of the campaign is that the robots have returned to remind the humans to be more human,” Sazerac chief marketing officer Sara Saunders\ntold\nTHR\nbefore the game.\nThe best AI ad didn’t mention the technology at all:\nBen Affleck/90’s sitcom Good Will Dunkin’ spoof\nused de-aging to some nifty effect, even if it dipped into the uncanny valley a few times. Of course this was AI as tool for human vision, not as replacement for human creativity, skill and decision-making.\nIt has become fashionable to rag on AI, and for some brands and public pronouncers this is, as you might warily suspect, a pose — a cheap monetization of hipster skepticism more than a carefully thought-out ideology. But a kernel of meaning sits at the heart of even the most blithe pushbacks — that we should ask what all this technology that has come to automate and convenientize our lives will take away with it.\nAI is coming and technology can’t be stopped; about that Bob Iger, who\nrecently made the point to David Muir,\nis right. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. Sure, as a broad concept the idea of AI is moving forward; there are too many stakeholders for it not to. And too many unassailably positive use cases for it not to. If you as a medical researcher could know a drug’s effects on the genome better, why wouldn’t you? If you’re a climate activist and can push for models that will limit waste, why wouldn’t you do that too? But AI as a\nconsumer deployment\nis far from assured; AI as something we’ll use to replace or at least seriously augment teachers and writers and designers and therapists is not necessarily an inevitability. We have no idea if people will want to use Sora en masse to animate characters on\nDisney\n+, as Iger\nis betting it will\n, or will be deemed safe enough to become all of our assistants, or trustworthy enough to give advice on our how to talk to our mothers.\nMost important of all — and this was decidedly hidden by the brands on\nNBC\nSunday night — we can do something about the onslaught. If we reject slop, AI video-generation tools get marginalized; if we evince skepticism about using a chatbot for mental health, Claude and ChatGPT see their reach curbed.\nIt’s telling that even as Google was making the case for how Gemini can think a house into existence and dispel the worry of its new inhabitants it used a very real Randy Newman singing “Feels Like Home” to make the point, and not, say, an AI trained on “the greatest living songwriters.” A more ironic undercutting of a tech company’s message you will not find: “Machines can address all of our emotional needs, and to convince you of that we’ll draw on the most human of artists.” But Big Tech leaders don’t really do irony, and they’re not worried about undercutting. Just keep pushing products that will make life more efficient, they believe, and hope that, faced with a world made so exhausting and overwhelming (by tech), consumers will grasp at any product that brings them momentary relief — the executives unaware, it seems, that we can simply be recruited not to participate.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe\nSign Up\nTHR, Esq\nOpenAI Wins Key Discovery Battle as It Gains Ground Against Authors in AI Lawsuits\ncasey wasserman\nCasey Wasserman Faces Artist Rebellion Amid Epstein Fallout\nWarner Bros.

This is forcing hobbyists to get extra crafty when it comes to sourcing new hardware.\nI don't think I've ever visited an e-waste recycling center and NOT come away shocked at what's being tossed out, and despite the current squeeze on hardware, I don't suspect it's getting much better. Such is the case for\none Reddit user\nwho came away with a \"major score at the dump\" this past weekend.\nOn their regular trip to the town's landfill to check for older components, they stumbled on a goldmine. Not only did they save a five-bay Drobo NAS, a Samsung monitor, a 10th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU with cooler, an ASUS motherboard, and \"a few other odds and ends\" from annihilation, but they also scored two 32GB DDR4 RAM modules.\nWho is throwing out 64GB of Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4 RAM in this economy?!\nA quick check of\nNewegg\nthis morning shows a\nused\n2x32GB kit of the same Corsair DDR4 RAM\nretailing for $500\n. The Reddit user shared an image showing the RAM lit up and (assumedly) running fine in a test PC.\nMajor score at the dump today!!!\nfrom\nr/pcmasterrace\nFor some additional background info, the\nReddit\nuser says they live in a town of about 8,000 people. The local landfill includes an e-waste recycling container, and the components they salvaged were just sitting out in the open.\nMost recycling depots in larger urban regions won't allow similar scavenging, for better or for worse. It's a shame considering how much perfectly usable hardware is thrown away on a daily basis, but then again, landfills and recycling depots don't need a horde of PC enthusiasts descending on their operations in the hopes of scoring some\ncheap\nfree parts.\nIt's\nestimated by some experts\nthat less than a quarter of all e-waste is properly recycled (as of 2022), which leaves billions of dollars of hardware and precious minerals just sitting around. At the world's current pace, e-waste is growing by about 2.6 million tons per year, and is expected to hit 82 million tons by 2030.\nWhether or not the ongoing \"RAMageddon\" and its fallout significantly influence these stats remains to be seen, but I can certainly see a future where a lot of old hardware that would normally be destined for a landfill gets upcycled into new PCs and projects. At least, one can hope.\nWhat's the best score you've ever found at a recycling center or landfill?

Then you'd better be willing to fork over some PII – just months after the company's age verification partner had such data stolen.\nStarting with a phased rollout in early March, Discord is going to put all new and existing users into a teen-appropriate experience by default, the company\nsaid\non Monday. That means communication restrictions, limits on access to age-gated spaces, and content filtering will be switched on by default regardless of a user's actual age - and loosening those settings will generally require proving you're not a minor.\n\"Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord's existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility,\" Discord global head of product policy Savannah Badalich said in the company's announcement. \"Nowhere is our safety work more important than when it comes to teen users.\"\nFor adults, regaining access to their chosen Discord spaces may mean handing over a copy of ID to one of the company's age verification vendors, or uploading a video selfie that will be used for age estimation. Unless Discord's background age-inference model decides you're an adult.\n\"Discord will implement its age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age,\" the company said.\nOpenAI will try to guess your age before ChatGPT gets spicy\nRemote ID verification tech is often biased, bungling, and no good on its own\nStudy finds radical nutjobs targeting gamers via Discord, Twitch, Steam\nSelfie-based authentication raises eyebrows among infosec experts\nDiscord users worried about handing over their personal information to Discord to prove they're old enough to chat with other adults are right to be worried. As noted above, a third-party customer service provider used by Discord was compromised last October, and attackers accessed images from\nroughly 70,000 government ID scans\nthat users had submitted as part of age-verification processes.\nThe language in Monday's announcement is vague about how data related to ID verification is processed and stored, stating that \"identity documents submitted to our vendor partners are deleted quickly\" without getting specific about who is doing the deletion and how soon. As for video selfies, Discord said that those \"never leave a user's device.\"\nVideo selfies seem like the better privacy choice based on that explanation, but it's worth pointing out that Discord might ask for multiple forms of identification \"if more information is needed to assign an age group.\"\nHopefully, you look your age, assuming this latest generation of Discord age-verification algorithms can't be\nfooled by a video game\n.\nDiscord didn't respond to questions for this story. ®\nMore about\nAI\nDiscord\nFacial Recognition\nMore like these\n×\nMore about\nAI\nDiscord\nFacial Recognition\nPrivacy\nNarrower topics\nAIOps\ncookies\nDeepSeek\nGemini\nGoogle AI\nGPT-3\nGPT-4\nLarge Language Model\nMachine Learning\nMCubed\nNeural Networks\nNLP\nPersonally Identifiable Information\nPrivacy Sandbox\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\nStar Wars\nTensor Processing Unit\nTOPS\nBroader topics\nMessaging\nSelf-driving Car\nMore about\n22\nCOMMENTS\nMore about\nAI\nDiscord\nFacial Recognition\nMore like these\n×\nMore about\nAI\nDiscord\nFacial Recognition\nPrivacy\nNarrower topics\nAIOps\ncookies\nDeepSeek\nGemini\nGoogle AI\nGPT-3\nGPT-4\nLarge Language Model\nMachine Learning\nMCubed\nNeural Networks\nNLP\nPersonally Identifiable Information\nPrivacy Sandbox\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\nStar Wars\nTensor Processing Unit\nTOPS\nBroader topics\nMessaging\nSelf-driving Car\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news",

Companies are already working on mass-producing\nAI\n-powered bots that can complete\nsimple household tasks\nlike folding clothes and washing dishes, while others move so realistically that developers have had to\ncut them open\nat showcases to prove they’re not actually\nhuman actors wearing suits\n.\nWhile most of these robots are clearly machines, one tech startup is seeking to make their newest product as close to human as possible, even making it give off body heat to mimic a real person.\nMoya is equipped with body heat and dense ‘skin’ for human companionship\nDroidUp\nis a robotics company based out of Shanghai that specializes in designing and manufacturing “humanoid” robots.\nIts latest creation, named ‘Moya,’ is going viral thanks to its uncanny resemblance to a real person. Described by\nChinese news outlets\nas “the world’s first highly bionic robot,” Moya is capable of realistic, advanced humanoid movement and expressions that set it apart from others of its kind.\nDroidUp\nMoya was developed with human companionship in mind.\nMoya stands at 5 feet 5 inches tall (165 cm) and weighs around 70 lbs (31 kg). Users can switch out the bot’s parts to give it a male or female build, change its hair, and customize it to their whims.\nDroidUp added extra layers of flesh-like padding beneath Moya’s silicone frame to make it feel more human to the touch, even including a ribcage. A camera behind her eyes helps Moya to track its surroundings and communicate with people.\nRelated\nAI-powered companion toys go viral in China for growing and talking to you\nDisney’s OpenAI deal reveals first look at DisneyGPT & Iron Man inspired AI tool\nReal-life Terminator: China’s T800 humanoid robot kicks CEO in wild combat demo\nThat’s not all; Moya is also heated, with a body temperature of 90 – 97 degrees Fahrenheit (32 – 36 degrees Celsius) to mimic humans’ body heat.\nSpeaking to the\nShanghai Eye\n, DroidUp founder Li Quingdu argued that a “robot that truly serves human life should be warm, almost like a living being that people can connect with,” not a cold, metal machine.\nThat’s exactly what DroidUp has designed Moya for; the company hopes to sell these models to healthcare companies and advertise them as ‘social companions.’\nMoya is projected to\ncost around $173,000\nand is expected to become available for sale in late 2026.\nThis is the latest invention from a Chinese robotics company to go viral after Shanghai-based startup Agibot Innovations\nset a Guinness World Record\nin 2025 when its humanoid robot walked 100km completely unassisted, braving traffic, pedestrians, and unsteady terrain.",

      "content_full": "General Motors\nThe biggest car news and reviews, no BS\nOur free daily newsletter sends the stories that really matter directly to you, every weekday.\nTerms of Service\n&\nPrivacy Policy.\nIt turns out that when fewer cars spew exhaust as they drive along, air quality improves. That’s the conclusion of a new study published in\nThe Lancet Planetary Health\nthat looked at the effect of increased numbers of both EVs and plug-in hybrids on air pollution in California.\nThe Golden State has by far the largest number of plug-in vehicles in the United States, and they’ve now reached significant numbers to have a positive impact on air quality. Between 2019 and 2023, for every 200 EVs or plug-in hybrids added, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels dropped 1.1%, according to the study, which used satellite data to track those levels through the unique way NO2 absorbs and reflects sunlight. NO2 can trigger asthma attacks, cause bronchitis, and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.\nNissan\nThe discussion around EVs tends to focus on their ability to limit climate change by reducing carbon emissions, but\nprevious studies\nhave also tried to draw connections between reduced exhaust emissions and improved air quality. However, this study claims to be the first to conclusively link increased EV adoption with lower levels of pollutants.\nDuring the study period, EVs and plug-in hybrids increased from 2% to 5% of all new light-duty vehicle registrations in California. To get a more detailed picture, researchers divided the state into 1,692 neighborhoods and used DMV data to track the number of plug-in vehicles registered in each one. Over the study period, the typical neighborhood gained 272 EVs and plug-in vehicles.\nHyundai\nResearchers controlled for changes in gas prices and work-from-home patterns that might affect driving behavior, eliminating the year 2020 entirely from the results due to the anomalous pandemic-related decrease in driving. They also confirmed that neighborhoods with an increase in gasoline-powered cars saw the expected increase in pollutants and checked satellite data against ground-level monitoring data from 2012 to 2023.\nThere is, to say the least, a vigorous debate about the pace of EV adoption. Costs and\ninfrastructure issues\nstill mean that EVs aren’t for everyone, but this study demonstrates why getting more of them on the road is a goal worth pursuing. If California follows through on its plan to\nend sales of most new gasoline cars\nby 2035, future residents of the state will breathe easier.\nGot a tip? Send it in: tips@thedrive.com",

But possibly not for long: Australian communications minister Anika Wells and the Australian eSafety commissioner's office have both written to Roblox expressing concern over \"graphic and gratuitous user-generated content\".\nWells has called on Roblox to explain how it's combatting child exploitation and self-harm material, and called for the Australian Classification Board to review its PG rating. Meanwhile, eSafety has also advised Roblox of its \"intention to directly test the platform's implementation and effectiveness of the nine safety commitments it made to Australia's online safety regulator last year.\"\nIn September last year Roblox agreed to nine commitments to comply with Australia's Online Safety Act. These included private accounts for under 16s, and the prohibition of voice chat for 13-15 year olds (it was already prohibited by Roblox for under 13s). Roblox said in late 2025 that it had complied with all nine commitments, some of which have been implemented globally, like\nnow-mandatory facial age checks\nto access chat features. Evidently, eSafety isn't satisfied.\n“We remain highly concerned by ongoing reports regarding the exploitation of children on the Roblox service, and exposure to harmful material,” eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a media statement. Grant added that, in addition to \"ongoing compliance monitoring\", eSafety will \"directly [test] the implementation of its commitments so that we have first-hand insights into this compliance\".\nDepending on the outcome of this testing, Roblox could face fines of up to AU$49.5 million.\nIn her own letter, Wells acknowledged ongoing media coverage of Roblox alleging that children are still accessing explicit content on the platform. She is seeking an \"urgent meeting\" with the company.\n\"I am alarmed by reports of children being exposed to graphic and gratuitous user-generated content on the platform, including sexually explicit and suicidal material,\" Wells wrote in an excerpt from her letter seen by PC Gamer. \"Even more disturbing are ongoing reports and concerns about children being approached and groomed by predators, who actively seek to exploit their curiosity and innocence.\"\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nAccording to\n7News\n, a Queensland man was accused last week of using Roblox and Fortnite to \"groom and coerce\" hundreds of children.\nFlorida attorney general James Uthmeier announced a criminal investigation into Roblox in October,\naccusing it\nof failing to protect children from predators and explicit content. In November, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton\nsaid\nthat \"'Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks.\"\nShaun Prescott\nAustralian Editor\nShaun Prescott is the Australian editor of PC Gamer.

When John Carmack tweets, though, folks tend to listen.\nHis latest musings\npertain using a protracted fiber loop as an L2 cache of sorts, to hold AI model weights for near-zero latency and gigantic bandwidth.\nCarmack came upon the idea after considering that single mode fiber speeds have reached 256 Tb/s, over a distance of 200 km. With some back-of-the-\nDoom\n-box math, he worked out that 32 GB of data are in the fiber cable itself at any one point.\nAI model weights can be accessed sequentially for inference, and almost so for training. Carmack's next logical step, then, is using the fiber loop as a data cache to keep the AI accelerator always fed. Just think of conventional RAM as just a buffer between SSDs and the data processor, and how to improve or outright eliminate it.\n256 Tb/s data rates over 200 km distance have been demonstrated on single mode fiber optic, which works out to 32 GB of data in flight, “stored” in the fiber, with 32 TB/s bandwidth. Neural network inference and training can have deterministic weight reference patterns, so it is…\nFebruary 6, 2026\nThe discussion spawned a substantial amount of replies, many from folks from high pay grades. Several pointed out that the concept in itself is akin to\ndelay-line memory\n, harkening back to the middle of the century when mercury was used as a medium, and soundwaves as data. Mercury's mercurialness proved hard to work with, though, and Alan Turing himself proposed using a\ngin\nmix as a medium.\nThe main real-world benefit of using a fiber line would actually be in power savings, as it takes a substantial amount of power to keep DRAM going, whereas managing light requires very little. Plus, light is predictable and easy to work with. Carmack notes that \"fiber transmission may have a better growth trajectory than DRAM,\" but even disregarding plain logistics, 200 km of fiber are still likely to be pretty pricey.\nSome commenters remarked other limitations outside of the fact that Carmack's proposal would require a lot of fiber. Optical amplifiers and DSPs could eat into energy savings, and DRAM prices will have to come down at some point anyway. Some, like Elon Musk, even suggested vacuum as the medium (space lasers!), though the practicality of such a design would be iffy.\nCarmack's tweet alluded to the more practical approach of using existing flash memory chips, wiring enough of them together directly to the accelerators, with careful consideration for timing. That would naturally require a standard interface agreed upon by flash and AI accelerator makers, but given the insane investment in AI, that prospect doesn't seem far-fetched at all.\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\nVariations on that idea have actually been explored by several groups of scientists. Approaches include\nBehemoth\nfrom 2021,\nFlashGNN\nand\nFlashNeuron\nfrom 2021, and more recently, the\nAugmented Memory Grid\n. It's not hard to imagine that one or several of these will be put into practice, assuming they aren't already.\nFollow\nTom's Hardware on Google News\n, or\nadd us as a preferred source\n, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.\nBruno Ferreira\nContributor\nBruno Ferreira is a contributing writer for Tom's Hardware.

Some kind of CRC code and if there's an error you read it from the storage again.\nReply\nScott_Tx\nsaid:\nThe same way any data transmitted over fiber is checked. Some kind of CRC code and if there's an error you read it from the storage again.\nSounds great!\nReply\nCarmack? Jim Keller came up with a similar idea back in 2024. Nice that John is adding to it, but we need to give credit where credit is due.\nReply\nSo what's stopping this from being a backbone like structure for nervous system linings throughout a robot for \"muscle memory\" storage?\nReply\nThe article\nsaid:\nAI model weights can be accessed sequentially for inference\nI think this isn't true, for transformer-type models.\nReply\nGururu\nsaid:\nAssuming current solid state media for L2 cache provide means for verification,\nYeah, L2 caches usually include some ECC.\nGururu\nsaid:\nI would be curious to know how data in a fiber might be managed free from corruption.\nWell, PCIe 6.0 added a forward-error-correction (FEC) header. This avoids the need to retransmit, in the event of small numbers of errors. It's conceptually similar to ECC, I think.\nFor all I know, protocols used over long-haul fiber might already employ such a mechanism.\nReply\nI think that next logical step to store temp data are limits of speed of light. Correction error management is a challenge.\nReply\nIt's one of the reasons I like looking at old computing stuff so much, right from the start in the 1940's. There is a video out there where JP Eckert discusses the ENIAC design (he might also be dissing John von Neumann), that's just so full of insights into those early stages. Likewise I consider Grace Hopper's lectures a must-see.\nI keep thinking that by the late 1960's pretty near everything in computing had already been invented, because those guys were really looking in every direction. And the various technologies around RAM were incredibly diverse, they really tried anything that somehow could hold state, expand capacity or relieve the memory bottleneck.\nWhether it was media (those delay lines, magnetic core, and then DRAM), virtual memory including fixed head magnetic drum drives, or the Harvard vs. the Princeton architecture or even content addressable memory, it had all been tried and tested. Also architecture things like >60 bit designs, single level store, or capability based computing went further than most manage even today.\nEven in terms of the math theory around computing, most things were already settled by Turing, Post, Shannon etc.\nLithography has given the industry incredible growth, but also extreme tunnel vision, Unix has also been a huge throwback compared to Multics.\nReply\nShow more comments",

It is also the largest monthly total since October 2025, which saw 153,074 layoffs.\n“Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January. Most of these plans were likely set at the end of 2025, signaling that employers are less-than-optimistic about the 2026 outlook,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and\nChief Revenue Officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas\n.\nIndustry-wise breakdown\nTransportation led with 31,243 cuts, primarily driven by UPS, which announced 30,000 layoffs following the end of its partnership with Amazon.\nTechnology followed with 22,291 cuts. Challenger noted, “While CEOs like Andy Jassy have mentioned that AI may cost jobs in the coming years, this cut seems driven more by overhiring and organizational restructuring than by new technology.”\nAI and job losses\nArtificial Intelligence\nwas cited as a reason for 7,624 job cuts in January, accounting for 7% of total layoffs, the report said.\nIn 2025, companies cited AI in 54,836 announced layoffs, and since tracking began in 2023,\nAI\nhas been referenced in 79,449 job cut announcements, representing 3% of all layoffs during this period.\nChallenger added, “It’s difficult to determine the precise impact of AI on layoffs.

      "content_full": "On Monday, Databricks\nannounced\nit reached a $5.4 billion revenue run rate, growing 65% year-over-year, of which more than $1.4 billion was from its AI products.\nCo-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi wanted to share these growth numbers because there’s so much talk about how AI is going to kill the SaaS business, he told TechCrunch.\n“Everybody’s like, ‘Oh, it’s SaaS. What’s going to happen to all these companies? What’s AI going to do with all these companies?’ For us, it’s just increasing the usage,” he said.\nTo be sure, he also wants to distance Databricks from the SaaS label, given that private markets value it as an AI company. Databricks on Monday also officially closed on its massive, previously announced $5 billion raise\nat a $134 billion valuation\n, and nabbed a $2 billion loan facility as well.\nBut the company is straddling both worlds. Databricks is still best known as a cloud data warehouse provider. A data warehouse is where enterprises store massive amounts of data to analyze for business insights.\nGhodsi called out, in particular, one AI product that’s driving usage of its data warehouse: its LLM user interface named Genie.\nGenie is an example of how a SaaS business can\nreplace its user interface\nwith natural language. For instance, he uses it to ask why warehouse usage and revenue spike on particular days.\nJust a few years ago, such a request required writing queries in a specific technical language, or having a special report programmed. Today, any product with an LLM interface can be used by anyone, Ghodsi noted. Genie is one reason for the company’s usage growth numbers, he said.\nThe threat of AI to SaaS isn’t, as\none AI VC jokingly tweeted\n, that enterprises will rip out their SaaS “systems of record” to replace them with vibe-coded homegrown versions. Systems of record store critical business data, whether it’s on sales, customer support, or finance.\n“Why would you move your system of record? You know, it’s hard to move it,” Ghodsi said.\nThe model makers aren’t offering databases to store that data and become systems of record anyway. Instead, they hope to replace the user interface with natural language for human use, or APIs or other plug-ins for AI agents.\nSo the threat to SaaS businesses, Ghodsi says, is that people no longer spend their careers becoming masters of a particular product: Salesforce specialists, or ServiceNow, or SAP. Once the interface is just language, the products become invisible, like plumbing.\n“Millions of people around the world got trained on those user interfaces. And so that was the biggest moat that those businesses have,” Ghodsi warned.\nSaaS companies that embrace the new LLM interface could grow, as Databricks is doing. But it also opens up possibilities for AI-native competitors to offer alternatives that work better with AI and agents.\nThat’s why Databricks created its Lakebase database designed for agents. He’s seeing early traction. “In its eight months that we’ve had it in the market, it’s done twice as much revenue as our data warehouse had when it was eight months old. Okay, obviously, that’s like comparing toddlers,” Ghodsi says. “But this is a toddler that’s twice as big.”\nMeanwhile, now that Databricks has closed on its massive funding round, Ghodsi tells us that the company is not immediately working on another raise, nor prepping for an IPO.\n“Now is not a great time to go public,” Ghodsi said. “I just wanted to be really well capitalized” should the markets go “south” again as they did in the 2022 downturn, when interest rates rose sharply after years of near-zero rates. A thick bank account “protects us, gives us many, many years of runway,” he added.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nali ghodsi\n,\nDatabricks\n,\nEnterprise\n,\nSaaS\n,\nStartups\nJulie Bort\nVenture Editor\nJulie Bort is the Startups/Venture Desk editor for TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Julie by emailing\njulie.bort@techcrunch.com\nor via\n@Julie188\non X.\nView Bio\nOctober 13-15\nSan Francisco, CA\nTickets are live at the lowest rates of the year.\nSave up to $680 on your pass now.\nMeet investors.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\nThis is\nThe Stepback\n, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more news about the streaming wars,\nfollow Emma Roth\n.\nThe Stepback\narrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for\nThe Stepback\nhere\n.\nHow it started\nFrom 2019 to around 2021, we were in the midst of a streaming renaissance. Paramount Plus, Disney Plus, Apple TV, Peacock, and HBO Max all made their debuts, challenging the dominance of Netflix and other legacy streamers like Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. New indie streaming services, like the cinephile-focused Criterion Channel, emerged during this time.\nSubscription prices were still relatively low. Heck, Disney Plus\ncost just $6.99\nwithout\nads\nat launch (it costs $11.99\nwith\nads now and $18.99 without). Fierce competition in the industry also brought about a slew of original series, like\nTed Lasso\n,\nThe Mandalorian\n, and\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds,\nthat made services other than Netflix actually worth subscribing to.\nBut things changed around 2022. As an influx of new services flooded the market,\nthe covid streaming signup boom\nwound down and many Netflix competitors struggled to reach profitability. Studios slashed orders for adult scripted series, while\ncanceling others\n. Even Netflix,\nwhich reported losing subscribers\nfor the first time in over a decade in April 2022, was feeling the pressure. The previously ad-free Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video responded to the crunch by sticking commercials into their streams, as services\nbegan hiking prices for subscribers\nand\nclamping down on password sharing\n.\nHow it’s going\nWhile Netflix has added 25 million more\nsubscribers in 2025\n— bringing its global total to 325 million — signups to other services have begun to plateau. Peacock most recently reported\nadding three million\nsubscribers over the last few months of 2025, while Paramount grew by 1.4 million subs during its third quarter. Disney last said Disney Plus\nadded 1.5 million\nsubscribers in the US and Canada in the three months leading up to November 2025 — but, like Netflix, it has stopped reporting\nthese numbers\neach quarter.\nIt’s getting more difficult for Netflix competitors to scrape up new subscribers, and many are offering exclusive sporting events to draw more signups. Paramount Plus, for example, is now the\nexclusive home to the UFC\n, while\nNBA fans can only watch Monday night games\non Peacock through the 2025 to 2026 season. Apple TV also exclusively\nstreams Major League Soccer games\n, and the same will go for\nFormula 1 races\nwhen the 2026 season kicks off in March.\nAdvertising has also become an even\nbigger source of revenue for streamers\n, as companies discover new and annoying\nways to bombard you with ads\n. Data from the market research firm Antenna revealed that\n46 percent of people\nin the US subscribed to Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, Netflix, Paramount Plus, Peacock, and Discovery Plus have ad-supported plans.\nWhat happens next\nNetflix’s $82.7 billion Warner Bros. acquisition is going to have a monumental impact on the streaming landscape. With the deal, Netflix will be in control of the content served to the 325 million and 128 million people signed up to its own streaming service and HBO Max, respectively. There may be substantial overlap there, though, as Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos\nsaid during a February 3rd antitrust hearing that 80 percent\nof HBO Max subscribers are also signed up to Netflix.\nNow, instead of fighting Netflix alone, competitors will likely have to do it together, whether through new bundles or consolidation. We’ve already seen bundling take off in recent years, which not only attracts subscribers by serving as a cheaper alternative to individual subscriptions, but is also shown to reduce churn, as subscribers considering cancelling a bundle might not want to cut off access to multiple services at once. Data from Antenna revealed that 80 percent of\nthe 1.6 million people who signed up\nfor the Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max bundle that launched in 2024 remained subscribed three months later.\nFurther consolidation is in the future, too. Disney is on track to fully merge Hulu within the Disney Plus app by the end of this year. Paramount, which has been fighting for months to wrestle Warner Bros. away from Netflix, is also rumored to\nmerge its Paramount Plus streaming service with Peacock\n.\nThough it’s starting to look like Netflix is going to emerge as the winner of the streaming race, its Warner Bros. merger still faces regulatory hurdles. Earlier this week, the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee raised concerns that the acquisition could result in higher prices for customers, harm the theater business, or reduce entertainment jobs. Meanwhile, Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO)\naccused Netflix\nof hosting\nthe “wokest content in the history of the world.”\nNetflix is currently locked in a battle for viewer attention with YouTube, TikTok, and even games like\nFortnite\n. As much as Netflix might try to challenge them\nby launching podcasts\n, trying out\nshort-form video feeds\n,\nrevamping its user interface on mobile\n, and focusing on cloud gaming, it’s going to be difficult to compete with platforms that are free.\nBy the way\nYouTube may not be thought of as a streamer in the traditional sense, but it has once again been crowned the\ntop-watched service\nfor the third year in a row, according to\ndata from Nielsen\n. Netflix competes with the platform “in every dimension for talent, for ad dollars, for subscription dollars, and for all forms of content,” Sarandos said during an\nearnings call in January\n.\nDisney is making some big moves, too. In addition to bringing a feed of\nAI-generated videos\nto the Disney Plus app,\ntheme parks head Josh D’Amaro\nwill take over as CEO of the company in March.\nNetflix’s latest attempt to get more eyeballs — and ears — on its platform is via podcasts. In addition to licensing shows from Spotify, iHeartMedia, and Barstool Sports, Netflix has launched\nsome original video podcasts of its own\n, featuring comedian Pete Davidson and former NFL star Michael Irvin.\nRead this\nFor more on the Netflix and Warner Bros. merger, check out this\ndeep dive on\nDecoder\nwith\nVerge\nalum Julia Alexander.\nIf you’re wondering how Netflix’s Warner Bros. acquisition could impact HBO,\nThe Wrap\nhas a fascinating report\nabout what might happen to the network’s content and linear channels, and whether Netflix will integrate HBO Max into its streaming service.\nNetflix has been streaming a lot of live events lately.\nThe Wall Street Journal\ndigs into\nhow Netflix learned from its early streams and what it’s doing to prevent glitches in the future.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nEmma Roth\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nDiscord will require a face scan or ID for full access next month\nThis whistle fights fascists\nAI-generated ads dropped the ball at this year’s Super Bowl\nApple is killing the old HomeKit tomorrow\nFerrari’s first EV will have an interior designed by Jony Ive\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

      "content_full": "Story text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nGoogle continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google’s streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money.\nFor as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by\n9to5Google\n, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely.\n“You have [x] views remaining,” the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there’s no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on\nGoogle’s support page\n.\nGoogle tells Ars Technica that no final decisions have been made about this feature, and the number of free lyric views will vary across the test. It’s still an “experiment,” but it does appear to be one that has expanded considerably in recent days. However, Google says “the vast majority” of users still have free access to lyrics. Here’s YouTube’s full statement on where things currently stand:\n“We are running an experiment with a small percentage of ad-supported users that may impact their ability to access the lyrics feature repeatedly. We often run experiments on YouTube Music to better inform our decisions around feature improvements. The majority of our global users will not see any changes to the lyrics feature.”\nThe app’s lyrics feature allows listeners to follow along as the song plays. However, only the first few lines are visible once free users in the test hit the lyric cut-off. After that, the lyrics are blurred. Users who want to keep seeing lyrics are advised to upgrade to a premium account, which costs $14 for both YouTube video and music or $11 for music only. The subscription also removes ads and adds features like downloads and higher-quality video streams.\nThe new paywall in YouTube Music.\nCredit:\n                                      /u/MrYeet22836 and /u/Vegetable_Common188\nThe new paywall in YouTube Music.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          /u/MrYeet22836 and /u/Vegetable_Common188\nThis change is not without precedent. Spotify began restricting access to lyrics for free users in 2024. However, the response was so ferociously negative that the company backtracked and restored lyric access to those on ad-supported accounts. YouTube Music doesn’t have the same reach as Spotify, which may help soften the social media shame. Many subscribers are also getting the premium service just because they’re paying for ad-free YouTube and may never know there’s been a change to lyric availability.\nAs Google has ratcheted up restrictions on free YouTube accounts, the service has only made more money. In Google’s most recent earnings report, it reported $60 billion in YouTube revenue across both ads and subscriptions (both YouTube Premium and YouTube TV). That’s almost $10 billion more than last year.\nLyrics in YouTube Music are provided by third parties that Google has to pay, so it’s not surprising that Google is looking for ways to cover the cost. It is, however, a little surprising that the company hasn’t just used AI to generate lyrics for free. Google has recently tested the patience of YouTube users with a spate of AI features, like\nunannounced AI upscaling\n,\nfake DJs\n, and comment summaries.\nThis story was updated with Google’s response.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

Kuhl and a jury, Mark Lanier argued that his client, plaintiff \"K.G.M.,\" suffered from mental health issues as a result of her social media addiction.\n\"These companies built machines designed to addict the brains of children, and they did it on purpose,\" Lanier said.\nLawyers for Meta and YouTube\ntold the jury that K.G.M.'s addiction stemmed from other issues in her life, not their negligence.\nK.G.M. will be referred to by her initials, or as Kaley G.M., because the alleged harms took place when she was a minor.\nLanier also charged that Meta and YouTube failed to warn of the dangers to young users posed by the design of their platforms.\nLanier underscored his opening remarks by speaking with a display of children's blocks in front of him: the words \"Addicting,\" \"Brains\" and \"Children\" appeared next to the letters A, B, and C.\n\"This case is about two of the richest corporations in history who have engineered addiction in children's brains,\" Lanier said. \"I'm going to show you the addiction machine that they built, the internal documents that people normally don't get to see, and emails from [Meta CEO] Mark Zuckerberg and YouTube executives.\"\nIn a selected portion of a 2015 email Lanier showed the court, Zuckerberg demanded that \"time spent increases by 12%\" on Meta platforms in order to meet internal business goals.\nAs for YouTube, Lanier said the platform, owned by Google, intentionally targeted young users because it could \"charge advertisers more\", as compared to its YouTube Kids platform.\nLanier then accused YouTube of trying to take advantage of busy parents looking for a \"digital babysitting service.\"\nWhen it was Meta's turn to make an opening statement, attorney Paul Schmidt pointed the jury to the question of whether Instagram was a substantial factor in K.G.M's mental health struggles.\nHe portrayed K.G.M as someone dealing with family turmoil, including neglect, physical and verbal abuse, and bullying by her parents.\nSchmidt told the jury he admired K.G.M because she \"worked hard to overcome\" her struggles. He referenced records that described domestic violence in K.G.M's family history and seeing therapists starting when she was three years old.\nOn a projector, Schmidt showed certain statements K.G.M made about her home life, including that her mother had screamed at her, called her stupid, and had made her want to kill herself.\n\"I recognise those are tough quotes,\" Schmidt told the jury. \"In a case that's about psychological distress, that is what you have to consider.\"\nThe proceedings on Monday marked the first day in what is poised to be a six-week trial with significant implications for similar lawsuits around the country likely to go to trial this year.\nThe Los Angeles trial will test legal arguments set forth by families claiming to have seen their children suffer due to their use of social media and the platforms which reject liability for how their platforms are used by people.\nOver the course of the next several weeks, there will be testimony from experts, family members of children who died, and by Zuckerberg, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, and Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube.\nJurors are also expected to hear from former Meta employees who quit and became whistleblowers regarding the issue of social media addiction among children.\nThe outcome of the trial may provide a benchmark for monetary damages that would likely impact thousands of cases brought by other plaintiffs, their families, state prosecutors, and school districts across the United States.\nIn one such case, brought by 29 state Attorneys General, prosecutors have just insisted that a California Federal judge require Meta to significantly alter or disable aspects of its business and platforms.\nIn a Monday filing, all of the state attorneys collectively requested an injunction that would force Meta to: remove all accounts known to belong to users under 13 years of age; to delete information the company has collected through Facebook and Instagram on users under the age of 13; and to delete algorithms and generative artificial intelligence tools using such data.\nA group of 18 of the state attorneys who are pursuing state-specific consumer protection claims against Meta also requested that the court force the company to: implement time restrictions for young users that would prohibit school-time and night-time use; deactivate \"addictive\" design features like infinite scroll and autoplay; and disable filters that enhance photos or perceptions of beauty.\nMeta over the last two years has rolled out certain features for \"teen accounts\" on Instagram, including content filtering for users under 16 years of age.\nThe state attorneys argued in the Monday filing that this work from Meta was little more than \"a public relations measure offering minimal real protections for teen users on the platforms\".\nMonday's proceedings in Los Angeles took place as about one hundred people watched from the gallery, including parents who believe their children died as a result of choices the companies made about how to design their algorithms, notifications and other features.\nThe companies also maintain they are not responsible for content that third parties post under federal law.\nSnapchat-parent Snap and TikTok both settled with K.G.M. last month and are no longer defendants in the case.\nHow can you keep your child safe online?\nTikTok settles just before social media addiction trial to begin\n'Is Gen Z really addicted to doomscrolling?'\nTikTok settles just before social media addiction trial to begin\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter\nto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.\nOutside the UK?

It’s not the entire tortellini, mind you. Despite being in the works for several years, Ferrari only revealed a\nphoto of the Luce’s cockpit\nahead of a full reveal in May. Specifically, its steering wheel, gauge cluster, dash, and center console.\nTo craft an innovative cabin and deliver a unique experience, Ferrari tasked the former head of design at Apple, Jony Ive, and his partner, Marc Newson. Once upon a time, Ive delivered some of the most representative pieces of tech: the iMac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. It’s more than fair to say that he and Newson’s new firm, LoveFrom, know a thing or two about how people interact with tech and how design affects the overall experience. It’s those credentials that allow them to comment on things like the oversized, all-inclusive screens found in most cars today, a trend started by Tesla.\nFerrari\nWhen reminded of a comment he previously made about his “soul dying a bit” when getting into a car with a “big screen in the middle,”\nIve said the following:\n“Yeah, I think a large touchscreen practically, functionally, doesn’t work. That’s incontrovertible. You have to look [at it], which you shouldn’t be. You’ve designed [something that’s] layers and layers deep,” Ive told\nThe Drive\neditor-in-chief Kyle Cheromcha\nduring a media roundtable organized by Ferrari.\n“Esoterically, you can say, ‘I’d rather not be reminded of working.’ I mean, I find that easy and lazy, and it was treated like fashion. It was just, ‘Oh, this is synonymous. Multitouch is synonymous with an advanced product.’\n“It served a purpose when we developed it, but we were very clear about why we developed it for the products we did. And the inside of a car is such a challenging and different environment,” Ive added.\nA possible solution to counter the trend of a single massive screen that controls everything—in some cases, even the positioning of the air vents—is to use many small screens rather than one main one. This way, the displays feel more integral to the driving experience. When asked about this, Ive and Newson explained that big screens had a sort of unwarranted, uncalled nature, at least when it came to their role in controlling a car’s functions.\n“You’ve still got to be judicious,” Newson told\nThe Drive\n. “A big screen is kind of gratuitous, really. Undertaking consequences.”\nFerrari\nMeanwhile, Ive has gone as far as saying that he’s troubled by the very fact that his creation, multi-touch screens, has been used in many applications, many of them irresponsibly.\n“It’s very correct [that I’m troubled by this],” Ive told the media. “When we were working on it, it was very clear that it was going to be a very powerful tool. Powerful tools need frameworks and structures to understand how to use them responsibly, and things move so fast now that I don’t think those frameworks were developed.\n“I think the tough thing is if you innovate, there will be unintended consequences. So it’s one of the reasons I’m not with the old company, and it’s one of the reasons I’m doing what I’m doing now. I take it very, very seriously,” Ive addded.\nGot a tip?

But it may be that AI isn't as big a cause of layoffs and redundancies as the companies enacting them might claim, and even when they are, it might be too much and far too soon, according to multiple sources of\nresearch collated by Sherwood\n.\nBig layoffs, big claims\nOver the past year, many tech companies have announced large, sweeping layoffs. By the middle of 2025, there were\nover 100,000 reported tech-industry redundancies\n, driven by large-scale layoffs at companies like Intel and\nMicrosoft\n. Even when not explicitly stated, many of those affected\nfelt it was because of companies pivoting towards AI investment and development\n, or because those companies were hoping to make major efficiency and performance savings by using AI to take over some roles.\nIn total,\nChallenger data suggests\nover 1.2 million employees were let go in 2025, marking the highest rate of job cuts since 2020. Many of these were led by government redundancies, particularly with regards to the\nshort-lived DOGE initiative\nheaded by Elon Musk.\nOf that larger total, firms specifically cited AI as the reason for them in around 55,000 cases, with Challenger reporting around 72,000 AI-related job losses since 2023. There was over a 1,100% increase year-on-year in 2025, which suggests an enormous swing in that direction and perhaps indeed, a genuine trend that AI is replacing workers.\nBut not so fast, because new reports suggest some of these employers may be using AI as an excuse to cover for underperforming businesses. This \"AI-washing\" may be a convenient excuse to cut expenses in a way that, to investors, sounds like more of a positive development than it might otherwise be.\nFalse alarm?\nThis trend was\nfirst called out by research from LSE\nin the first-half of 2025, which found that many companies within the agriculture industry were claiming to use AI, but weren't at all. Even the ones that did were often augmenting humans with AI rather than replacing them with it, and yet it didn't stop them from talking up their AI use to seem more innovative than it actually was.\nCNBC made similar claims in November last year\n, citing tariff and trade uncertainties, as well as a turbulent economy overall, as more likely reasons for layoffs than the AI-inspired layoff claims made by many of the companies behind them.\nIn January this year,\nForrester put out a report\nsuggesting that, despite the grandiose claims by AI developers, it estimates only 6% of US jobs will be automated by 2030, suggesting that widespread AI job replacement is extremely unlikely. Indeed, it even projects that the majority of job layoffs attributed to AI so far and in the near future are likely to be reversed as companies realise the challenges of effectively implementing AI.\nAs for those let go over claimed AI improvements, it suggests that often it's more the case of company financials driving the decision, rather than technical innovation. Although it did suggest that customer service, software developers, and junior technical positions were under the most pressure from AI, it was rare that companies announcing AI-related layoffs had any kind of mature AI solution to fill those roles effectively.\nIt concluded that to fully realise the potential of AI, companies would need to invest in human employees and their training to help make the best use of the new technologies, rather than replacing workers with it outright.\nOxford Economics found similar results in\nits report from January\n, suggesting that although AI was being cited as a reason behind some layoffs, the majority were more commonly affected by traditional economic and business factors. It suggests that if AI were already replacing labor at a grand scale, we'd be seeing an increase in productivity to account for it, but there's little sign of that so far.\nOther research out of\nThe Budget Lab\nsuggests that economic and employment trends that predate the introduction of AI into the workplace are much more impactful. Its data so far suggests, \"there is no substantial acceleration in the rate of change in the composition of the labor market since the introduction of ChatGPT.\"\nIt even highlights how there is little difference in employment patterns for age groups 20 to 24 and 25 to 34. If AI were disrupting entry-level positions on the scale some suggest, it would be expected to see recent graduates struggling more for employment. But its data suggests that just isn't the case and that patterns are largely similar to how they were a decade ago - though it does suggest that its smaller sample size may be hiding larger trends.\n\"The picture of AI’s impact on the labor market that emerges from our data is one that largely reflects stability, not major disruption at an economy-wide level,\" it concludes.\nFiring for the future\nEven when companies that did legitimately let people go or make certain positions redundant because of what they see as AI efficiency savings and performance improvements, often the data suggests they've jumped the gun. In a\nsurvey conducted in December 2025 by the Harvard Business Review\n, where over 1,000 executives were polled at various global companies, the results suggested the vast majority of changes made to businesses because of AI were because of expected future potential rather than existing evidence of improvement.\nOver 600 of the polled executives claimed to have made layoffs at their businesses in anticipation of what AI will be able to do in the future, rather than because of anything it can do, or has done recently. Another 29% of those polled said that they had reduced their hiring rates because of the anticipation of what AI will be capable of down the line. Only two percent of those polled said they had made large layoffs because of actual AI implementation.\nThis would certainly track with previous research we've seen.\nMIT reported in August\nlast year that over 95% of generative AI deployments at businesses fail to make any kind of tangible improvement to profit or loss.\nIt's not nothing, but it's not a lot either\nDespite the data suggesting that AI-layoffs are overstated, or over-reported, and maybe not realistic in any tangible numbers, they do exist. I have lost work because places I wrote for now use AI to write their blog posts for them. Major publications have let go of many reporters because AI search summaries have impacted traffic.\nMajor industries are having to pivot and change because of AI, and workers are missing out. But not on the grand scale that AI companies sold us on, and maybe we don't need to be quite as nervous as we otherwise might be.\nAI is changing things, but not as much as it may seem.\nJon Martindale\nFreelance Writer\nJon Martindale is a contributing writer for Tom's Hardware.

      "content_full": "In a viral video\ncaptured during the ICE surge in Portland, Maine, an agent pointed his phone at a constitutional observer, snapped a photo, and offered a chilling, off-the-cuff warning: She was being added to a “database” of “domestic terrorists.” The brief exchange offered a glimpse into the petty and vindictive mindset of ICE agents. It also offered us a window into the mechanics of a hyperefficient, privatized surveillance state, one that bypasses the pesky barriers of the Fourth Amendment by putting our user data on the government’s credit card.\nLast month’s Americanization of TikTok is perhaps the zenith of this strategy. While liberal hawks cheered the platform’s transition to the jumble of jargon now known officially as TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC as a win for national security, they ignored the details written in the fine print. TikTok’s Privacy Policy has for some time included tracking of location and\ncitizenship status\n(among other identity markers, such as sex). They’ve recently updated their language to add more specificity about the personal data they track so as to be in compliance with state laws.*\nBy housing TikTok’s data on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure—a firm whose multibillion-dollar existence is owed in part to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement contracts, and whose co-founder Larry Ellison recently bragged about AI ushering in an era where “\ncitizens are on their best behavio\nr”—the government has finally achieved its aim of securing the app by integrating it into its domestic surveillance dragnet. Considering the drive to secure TikTok was driven by fears of what the notoriously repressive nation of China might do with our private data, this outcome is, at the very least, highly ironic.\nThe technical wizardry of this surveillance relies on your Mobile Advertising ID, or MAID, a unique string of alphanumeric characters assigned to every smartphone. Every time an app, be it TikTok or a simple weather tracker,\nmakes a bid to show you an advertisement\n, if your location services are enabled,\nit shares both your MAID and your precise GPS coordinates to thousands of private bidders\n.\nIn the past, this metadata has been used by the Pentagon to identify targets.\nData brokers like\nVenntel and Babel Street\nharvest these “bid-stream” crumbs into massive, searchable oceans of movement. For ICE, this means they no longer need a wiretap; they can access a digital twin of your life, where your TikTok scrolling habits are pinned to a physical map of your home, workplace, and your child’s school or day care.\nThe Fourth Amendment nominally requires a warrant and probable cause to search your person or effects. But in the age of surveillance capitalism, the Department of Homeland Security has discovered a loophole: Why bother with a judge when you can just buy the data from a private broker?\nThis is the spending-around strategy\n. By leveraging data originating from TikTok and similar platforms, ICE no longer needs to infiltrate communities. They simply tap into the flow of data already being harvested by private entities, allowing them to target both the undocumented and the political opposition.\nOnce this data enters the DHS ecosystem, it doesn’t sit in a silo. It’s fed into a high-tech meat grinder of enforcement tools designed to identify and disappear people with industrial efficiency. These include\nICE’s ELITE app\n(developed by Palantir), which fuses government and private data to generate neighborhood maps and individual dossiers of targets, each with an individualized “confidence score.”\nThis app can tap into everything from Flock license plate readers to\nRing cameras\n, allowing ICE to follow targets without being physically present. One can easily imagine a scenario where data originating from TikTok provides the last missing piece—user location and citizenship status—that ICE needs to green-light one of its raids.\nPerhaps most dangerously, ICE is now utilizing advanced social media monitoring to perform “\nsentiment analysis\n.” By scraping TikTok and other platforms, they can monitor the emotional and political temperature of entire geographic areas, identifying resistance hot spots. This completely undermines the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\nLegally, this system is built on the crumbling foundation of the third-party doctrine, a legal relic from the 1970s. This doctrine posits that individuals forfeit their “reasonable expectation of privacy” the moment they “voluntarily” share information with a third party, like a bank, a phone company, or a social media app.\nWhile the Supreme Court’s 2018\nCarpenter v. United States\nruling suggested that tracking a person’s location via cell towers requires a warrant, DHS has sidestepped this by arguing that purchased data is fundamentally different from subpoenaed data. In the eyes of DHS, when ICE buys a location profile from a broker, it isn’t conducting a search of a person, it’s completing a commercial transaction with a business.\nIt increasingly seems that the Americanization of TikTok was never about protecting us from a foreign adversary. It was a tactical acquisition of digital infrastructure. Trump’s DHS is treating the Bill of Rights like a market inefficiency—a cost of doing business that can be mitigated through the right corporate partnership. In this case, it’s working hand in glove with the social media platform favored by America’s most politically active demographic cohort.\nFortunately, there is a legislative solution. Congress should move immediately to pass the\nFourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act\n, or FANFSA. This law would prohibit law enforcement and intelligence agencies from purchasing data, such as a user’s location or viewing history, that would otherwise require a warrant, court order, or subpoena. The House passed the bill with bipartisan support in 2024 before it stalled in the Senate.\nThe legal architecture of FANFSA is designed to codify and expand upon the Supreme Court’s\nCarpenter\nruling. In that case, the court recognized that the “near perfect surveillance” enabled by digital location data requires a warrant, even if that data is held by a third party. However,\nCarpenter\nleft a gaping hole: While it restricted the government from compelling companies to hand over data without a warrant, it remained silent on the government simply purchasing that same data on the open market.\nFANFSA seeks to bridge this gap by amending the Stored Communications Act to prohibit law enforcement and intelligence agencies from using “anything of value” (in this case, taxpayer dollars) to bypass judicial oversight. By doing so, the Act effectively asserts that the third-party doctrine cannot be used as a commercial loophole to circumvent the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement.\nThe Americanization of TikTok has also introduced a more visible form of suppression through the algorithmic throttling of dissent. In the wake of recent ICE shootings in Minneapolis, users and high-profile creators alike reported that anti-ICE videos were instantly met with “zero views” or flagged as “ineligible for recommendation,” effectively purging them from the platform’s influential “For You” feed.\nThe new TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC attributed these irregularities to a convenient\ndata center power outage\nat its Oracle-hosted facilities. While the public attention this episode garnered will make it more conspicuous if user content gets throttled on TikTok again, the tools are there: By leveraging shadow bans and aggressive content moderation, TikTok can, if it wanted to, ensure that any visual evidence of ICE’s overreach is silenced before it reaches the masses.\nWhen the government can buy its way around the Constitution, the result is what we saw in Portland: an ICE agent labeling a citizen a “terrorist” for exercising her First Amendment rights. If Congress allows these private data loopholes to stand, ICE’s database will soon include anyone who dares to criticize the administration. And content filtering will ensure that any video record of ICE violating our civil liberties will remain unseen.\nWhen that happens, the Roberts court won’t need to gut the First and Fourth Amendments. It can just wait until everyone agrees to the privacy policy.\n*\nThis article originally misidentified TikTok’s privacy policy. It also misidentified the extant privacy policy as an updated one.\nThis article has been updated throughout for clarity.\nLogan McMillen\nLogan McMillen works in information services and is a former educator. His research interests include political rhetoric and political ethics.\nRead More:\nPolitics\n,\nTikTok\n,\nSurveillance\n,\nSurveillance State\n,\nChina\n,\nTechnology\n,\nSilicon Valley\n,\nSurveillance Capitalism\n,\nICE\n,\nICE Violence\n,\nImmigration",

Hims had planned to offer the oral drug for as little as $49 for the first month, roughly $100 less than Novo's approved Wegovy pill.\nIn a statement on Monday, Hims said the lawsuit is \"a blatant attack by a Danish company on millions of Americans who rely on compounded medications for access to personalized care\" and is another case of Big Pharma \"weaponizing the US judicial system to limit consumer choice.\"\nHims added it has a \"long history of providing safe access to personalized healthcare\" to patients.\nwatch now\nVIDEO\n3:28\n03:28\nHealth and Human Services General Counsel Mike Stuart on referring Hims & Hers to the DOJ\nMoney Movers\nNovo Nordisk's Copenhagen-listed shares climbed more than 3% on Monday, while Hims' NYSE-listed stock fell more than 18%.\nThe lawsuit comes as Novo works to reclaim market share in the booming obesity drug market and fend off competition from both\nEli Lilly\nand a wave of compounded alternatives. Those copycats have proliferated under a regulatory loophole that allows companies like Hims to sell compounded versions of patent-protected drugs when branded treatments are in short supply.\nSemaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo's pill and its blockbuster injections — is no longer in shortage in the U.S., thanks to the company's efforts to ramp up manufacturing capacity. There are no shortages reported for the Wegovy pill, which has had an explosive launch since it entered the U.S. market in early January.\nEven so, Novo estimated in January that as many as 1.5 million Americans are using compounded GLP-1 drugs.\nHims has said its compounded pill and other GLP-1 products contain semaglutide, despite the ingredient being protected by U.S. patents through 2032. Hims has said its versions are legal because they are \"personalized\" in dosage.\nBut Novo said it does not directly or indirectly sell semaglutide for copycats, and accused Hims of engaging in illegal mass compounding.\n\"I would just say we do want an end to mass compounding, to unlawful mass compounding,\" Kuckelman said, noting that Novo is not trying to stop all compounding practices.\nHe said compounding has to be based on legitimate grounds, \"as opposed to you producing mass stocks of what you're calling a personalized medicine, which is really just a dosage variation.\"\nCompounded drugs can be produced on a case-by-case basis when a doctor determines it is medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug.\nMore CNBC health coverage\nThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for you\nU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump says\nEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs\nOn Friday, the Food and Drug Administration\nannounced\nit planned to take legal action against Hims for the pill, including restricting access to the ingredients and referring the company to the Department of Justice over potential violations.\nKuckelman said some telehealth platforms, such as Ro, \"are doing the right things\" by transitioning to providing patients with real FDA-approved products from Novo and its competitors.\nBut \"some won't, and the only way it appears that we're going to get Hims and others to stop this is through hopefully government enforcement actions and through lawsuits like the one that we've filed today,\" he said.\nNovo and Lilly have aggressively cracked down on compounding pharmacies over the past two years as they benefit from the soaring popularity of their weight loss and diabetes drugs. Novo has so far filed around 130 lawsuits dealing with deceptive marketing practices and consumer fraud, Kuckelman said.\nLilly has gone through a\nsimilar legal process\nwith tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro, which is no longer in short supply in the U.S.",

      "content_full": "Security\n13\nMore than 135,000 OpenClaw instances exposed to internet in latest vibe-coded disaster\n13\nBy default, the bot listens on all network interfaces, and many users never change it\nBrandon Vigliarolo\nMon 9 Feb 2026\n//\n17:23 UTC\nIt's a day with a name ending in Y, so you know what that means: Another OpenClaw cybersecurity disaster.\nThis time around, SecurityScorecard's STRIKE threat intelligence team is sounding the alarm over the sheer volume of internet-exposed OpenClaw instances it discovered, which numbers more than 135,000 as of this writing. When combined with previously known vulnerabilities in the vibe-coded AI assistant platform and links to prior breaches, STRIKE warns that there's a systemic security failure in the open-source AI agent space.\n\"Our findings reveal a massive access and identity problem created by poorly secured automation at scale,\" the STRIKE team wrote in a\nreport\nreleased Monday. \"Convenience-driven deployment, default settings, and weak access controls have turned powerful AI agents into high-value targets for attackers.\"\nFor those unfamiliar with the saga of Clawdbot, er Moltbot, no, wait, OpenClaw (it keeps changing names), it's an open-source, vibe-coded agentic AI platform that has been, frankly, an unmitigated disaster for those worried about security. OpenClaw's skill store, where users can find extensions for the bot, is\nriddled with malicious software\n.\nThree\nhigh-risk\nCVEs\nhave been attributed to it in recent weeks, and it's also been reported that its various skills can be easily cracked and forced to spill API keys, credit card numbers, PII, and other data valuable to cybercriminals.\nTake a bunch of those already vulnerable instances and give them free rein to access the internet, as STRIKE has discovered happening around the world, and those problems are quickly magnified.\nSTRIKE's summary of the problem doesn't even do it justice, as the number of identified vulnerable systems has skyrocketed on its live OpenClaw threat\ndashboard\nsince publication several hours before our story.\nTake the aforementioned 135,000+ internet-facing OpenClaw instances - that number is as of our writing; when STRIKE published its report earlier today, that number was at just over 40,000. STRIKE also mentioned 12,812 OpenClaw instances it discovered being vulnerable to an established and already patched\nremote code execution\nbug. As of this writing, the number of RCE-vulnerable instances has jumped to more than 50,000. The number of instances detected that were linked to previously reported breaches (not necessarily related) has also skyrocketed from 549 to over 53,000, as has the number of internet-facing OpenClaw instances associated with known threat actor IPs.\nIn other words, this is nothing short of a disaster in the making, all thanks to a suddenly-popular AI tool vibe-coded into existence with little regard to the safety of its codebase or users.\nThat's not to say users aren't at least partially to blame for the issue. Take the way OpenClaw's default network connection is configured.\n\"Out of the box, OpenClaw binds to `0.0.0.0:18789`, meaning it listens on all network interfaces, including the public internet,\" STRIKE noted. \"For a tool this powerful, the default should be `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). It isn't.\"\nSTRIKE recommends all OpenClaw users, at the very least, immediately change that binding to point it to localhost. Outside of that, however, SecurityScorecard's VP of threat intelligence and research Jeremy Turner wants users to know that most of the flaws in the system aren't due to user inattention to defaults. He told\nThe Register\nin an email that many of OpenClaw's problems are there by design because it's built to make system changes and expose additional services to the web by its nature.\n\"It's like giving some random person access to your computer to help do tasks,\" Turner said. \"If you supervise and verify, it's a huge help. If you just walk away and tell them all future instructions will come via email or text message, they might follow instructions from anyone.\"\nAs STRIKE pointed out, compromising an OpenClaw instance means gaining access to everything the agent can access, be that a credential store, filesystem, messaging platform, web browser, or just its cache of personal details gathered about its user.\nClouds rush to deliver OpenClaw-as-a-service offerings\nGitHub ponders kill switch for pull requests to stop AI slop\nAI agents can't yet pull off fully autonomous cyberattacks – but they are already very helpful to crims\nOpen-source AI is a global security nightmare waiting to happen, say researchers\nAnd with many of the exposed OpenClaw instances coming from organizational IP addresses and not just home systems, it's worth pointing out that this isn't just a problem for individuals mucking around with AI.\nTurner warns that OpenClaw isn't to be trusted, especially in organizational contexts.\n\"Consider carefully how you integrate this, and test in a virtual machine or separate system where you limit the data and access with careful consideration,\" Turner explained. \"Think of it like hiring a worker with a criminal history of identity theft who knows how to code well and might take instructions from anyone.\"\nThat said, Turner isn't advocating for individuals and organizations to completely abandon agentic AI like OpenClaw - he simply wants potential users to be wary and consider the risks when deploying a potentially revolutionary new tech product that's rife with vulnerabilities.\n\"All these new capabilities are incredible, and the researchers deserve a lot of credit for democratizing access to these new technologies,\" Turner told us. \"Learn to swim before jumping in the ocean.\"\nOr just stay out altogether - the ocean is terrifying. ®\nMore about\nAI\nCybersecurity\nSoftware\nMore like these\n×\nMore about\nAI\nCybersecurity\nSoftware\nVulnerability\nNarrower topics\nAdBlock Plus\nAIOps\nApp\nApplication Delivery Controller\nAudacity\nCenter for Internet Security\nConfluence\nDatabase\nDeepSeek\nFOSDEM\nFOSS\nGemini\nGoogle AI\nGPT-3\nGPT-4\nGrab\nGraphics Interchange Format\nIDE\nImage compression\nJenkins\nLarge Language Model\nLegacy Technology\nLibreOffice\nMachine Learning\nMap\nMCubed\nMicrosoft 365\nMicrosoft Office\nMicrosoft Teams\nMobile Device Management\nNeural Networks\nNLP\nOpenOffice\nProgramming Language\nQR code\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\nRetro computing\nRSA Conference\nSearch Engine\nSoftware bug\nSoftware License\nStar Wars\nTensor Processing Unit\nText Editor\nTOPS\nUser interface\nVisual Studio\nVisual Studio Code\nWebAssembly\nWeb Browser\nWordPress\nY2K\nZero Day Initiative\nZero trust\nBroader topics\nSecurity\nSelf-driving Car\nMore about\n13\nCOMMENTS\nMore about\nAI\nCybersecurity\nSoftware\nMore like these\n×\nMore about\nAI\nCybersecurity\nSoftware\nVulnerability\nNarrower topics\nAdBlock Plus\nAIOps\nApp\nApplication Delivery Controller\nAudacity\nCenter for Internet Security\nConfluence\nDatabase\nDeepSeek\nFOSDEM\nFOSS\nGemini\nGoogle AI\nGPT-3\nGPT-4\nGrab\nGraphics Interchange Format\nIDE\nImage compression\nJenkins\nLarge Language Model\nLegacy Technology\nLibreOffice\nMachine Learning\nMap\nMCubed\nMicrosoft 365\nMicrosoft Office\nMicrosoft Teams\nMobile Device Management\nNeural Networks\nNLP\nOpenOffice\nProgramming Language\nQR code\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\nRetro computing\nRSA Conference\nSearch Engine\nSoftware bug\nSoftware License\nStar Wars\nTensor Processing Unit\nText Editor\nTOPS\nUser interface\nVisual Studio\nVisual Studio Code\nWebAssembly\nWeb Browser\nWordPress\nY2K\nZero Day Initiative\nZero trust\nBroader topics\nSecurity\nSelf-driving Car\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news",

It’s going to be a reskinned and rebadged\nelectric Toyota Hig\nh\nlander\n. We are all about to get a preview of what Subaru has cooking as the electric Highlander\ndebuts Tuesday, February 10\n.\nThe electric Subaru three-row SUV, along with the electric Toyota Highlander and a yet-to-be-named Lexus variant, will all be built in Kentucky at Toyota’s Georgetown factory.\nThe Drive\nreached out to Subaru for comment and a spokesperson said, “we can’t comment on future product.”\nThe unnamed three-row Subaru SUV will be the automaker’s fourth EV.\nThe Solterra\n, the automaker’s first EV and a reskinned version of the Toyota bZ, is about to be joined by\nthe Trailseeker\nand\nUncharted\n. The former is a wagon version of the Solterra and reskin of the Toyota bZ Woodland while the latter is a small hatch-like SUV that is a reskin of the Toyota CH-R.\nWalters said Subaru will focus its EV efforts on households with two vehicles and access to a charger.\nThe electric three-row Subaru SUV is expected to feature Toyota controls and software, but to date, the Solterra’s offered a better value and user experience than its Toyota siblings. We’ll have to wait to see how the extension of this partnership unfolds, but consumers are about to have more choice in the electric marketspace.\nGot a tip about future product?

The system allowed Russian forces to coordinate movements and drone strikes in areas where military radios were unreliable or easily jammed.\n‘It is a war of drones now’: the ever-evolving tech dominating the frontline in Ukraine\nRead more\nRussia has no homegrown alternative that comes close in terms of speed, coverage or ease of use.\nUkraine\nsays Russian units had started fitting drones with Starlink terminals, improving their accuracy and making them harder to disrupt electronically.\nMusk said last week that efforts made to block Russian use of Starlink had had an effect. “Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorised use of Starlink by Russia have worked,” he wrote on X.\nThe move was an early victory for Ukraine’s new defence minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, given Musk’s past reluctance to be drawn too deeply into the conflict and comments often seen as favourable to Moscow.\nUkrainian officials said they had introduced a “whitelist” system, allowing only verified Starlink terminals to connect to the network, in effect locking out devices believed to be in Russian hands.\nIt remains unclear how far the change will affect Russian forces on the battlefield. The shutdown, however, has prompted anger and frustration among pro-war Russian military bloggers who are closely embedded with frontline units.\nA Ukrainian soldier using a Starlink terminal.\nPhotograph: Reuters\n“What everyone feared for a long time has happened,” wrote Yuriy Podolyaka, a Crimea-based video blogger with a following of almost 3 million on Telegram. “Elon Musk flipped the switch … our communications are in chaos.”\nAnother large pro-war Telegram channel, Dva Mayora, said the loss of Starlink had already been felt. “The deactivation of Starlink terminals used by Russian forces has had a negative impact on communications in our units,” it posted, adding that troops were rushing to set up backup systems that were “less convenient”.\nAnalysts say alternatives exist but fall well short of Starlink. For short-range links, units can rely on fibre-optic lines, wifi-based radio bridges or digital radio modems, all of which are slower to deploy and harder to use in mobile operations.\nRussia also has its own satellite communications, including systems run by Gazprom Space Systems, which have been used on a limited scale during the war. But the company operates only a small number of geostationary satellites, meaning patchy coverage and lower data capacity.\nRussian forces appear to be seeking workarounds to continue using Starlink, turning to intermediaries inside Ukraine and civilians prepared to register terminals in their own names.\n“For the enemy, Starlink is so important that they are trying to build an entire network of people willing to register terminals for them,” Ukraine’s defence ministry said on Telegram, alongside screenshots it said showed Russians advertising for Ukrainian nationals to activate the devices.\nThe issue has fuelled anger in Moscow that, four years into the war, the Russian army remains heavily dependent on western technology. “It is important to understand that relying on anything western in the current situation is dangerously overconfident,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, a State Duma lawmaker. “Even taking into account the active negotiations we are currently holding with the United States, that does not stop them from being our adversary.”\nExplore more on these topics\nRussia\nUkraine\nElon Musk\nSpaceX\nEurope\nDrones (military)\nSatellites\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content",

For instance, when I face life-related problems take might take me hours or days to figure out, a short session with an LLM can significantly quicken that process.\n\nSince the original Llama was leaked, I've been using LLMs locally, but they I always felt they were lacking behind OpenAI or Google models. Thus, I would always go back to using ChatGPT or Gemini when I need serious output. If I needed a long chatting session or help with long documents, I didn't have choice to use the SOTA models, and that means willingly leaking personal or work-related data.\n\nFor me, Gemini-3 is the best model I've ever tried. I don't know about you, but I struggle sometimes to follow chatGPT's logic, but I find it easy to follow Gemini's. It's like that best friend who just gets you and speaks in your language.\n\nWell, that was the case until I tried Qwen3-Coder-Next. For the first time, I could have stimulating and enlightening conversations with a local model. Previously, I used not-so-seriously Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking as local daily driver, but that model always felt a bit inconsistent; sometimes, I get good output, and sometimes I get dumb one.\n\nHowever, Qwen3-Coder-Next is more consistent, and you can feel that it's a pragmatic model trained to be a problem-solver rather than being a sycophant. Unprompted, it will suggest an author, a book, or a theory that already exists that might help. I genuinely feel I am conversing with a fellow thinker rather than a echo chamber constantly paraphrasing my prompts in a more polish way. It's the closest model to Gemini-2.5/3 that I can run locally in terms of quality of experience.\n\n**For non-coders, my point is do not sleep on Qwen3-Coder-Next simply because it's has the \"coder\" tag attached.**\n\nI can't wait for for Qwen-3.5 models. If Qwen3-Coder-Next is an early preview, we are in a real treat.",

Infographics, posters, slides, even Chinese calligraphy. Probably the best text-in-image I've seen from an open lab\n* Multi-panel comic generation (4×6) with consistent characters\n\nThe 7B size is the exciting part here. If/when weights drop, this should be very runnable on consumer hardware. V1 at 20B was already popular in ComfyUI, a 7B version doing more with less is exactly what local community needs.\n\nDemo is up on Qwen Chat if you want to test before committing any hopium to weights release.",

We know each other from the past, i.e., I’ve interviewed for multiple roles at this firm over the last 5-6 years.\n\nThis role landed on my LinkedIn feed randomly. I commented on the post and emailed the hiring manager directly, we had a short back-and-forth, and his recruiter called me almost immediately. The process has been unusually smooth by modern standards.\n\nToday’s panel felt strong. I’m confident I cleared the bar with both the Azure SME and the hiring manager. I saw visible agreement on several answers, got verbal acknowledgment more than once and handled questions from a junior panelist with ease. I was told that I’m “first in line” (not sure if that means FIFO or first on the shortlist), however,  it seemed to be directionally positive.\n\nHere’s the problem: I was laid off a little over six months ago and I am EXHAUSTED. It's like I've been on the hamster wheels of interviews since 8/4/2025. I’ve done the prep, the loops, the panels, the follow-ups. I know I’m good enough to be gainfully employed as a DevOps engineer.\n\nIf this role doesn’t turn into an offer, I’m seriously questioning whether I want to continue in tech at all. I don’t know if I have it in me to keep doing 5–7 round interview gauntlets, only to be rejected for vague reasons like “culture fit” or not smiling enough. I’ve given my adult life to STEM / engineering / corporate IT / tech and I am exhausted from having to engage with recruiters who want someone to take managerial roles for IC level pay.\n\nI’m not bitter about rejection. I’m tired of dysfunction...hiring managers who don’t know the difference between EC2 and AWS Lambda, recruiters who can’t distinguish an AWS account from an Azure subscription and BS interview processes that ding candidates for being \"too intense\".\n\nSo I’m asking honestly: when is it time to walk away?\nFor those who’ve been at a similar crossroads...did you step back temporarily, change strategy or leave tech altogether?\n\n\nTL;DR: Six months, countless interviews, strong signals in today's tech panel. If today's tech panel doesn’t result in an offer, I’m seriously considering being done with the tech interview industrial complex.",

There are already uses for Rust in production environments, some Linux distributions shipping with Rust kernel code, and millions of Android devices also using it. Miguel Ojeda wrote on that patch:\n\"The experiment is done, i.e. Rust is here to stay.\nI hope this signals commitment from the kernel to companies and other entities to invest more into it, e.g. into giving time to their kernel developers to train themselves in Rust.\nThanks to the many kernel maintainers that gave the project their support and patience throughout these years, and to the many other\ndevelopers, whether in the kernel or in other projects, that have made this possible. I had a long list of 173 names in the credits of the original pull that merged the support into the kernel, and now such a list would be way longer, so I will not even try to compose one, but again, thanks a lot, everybody.\"\nThat patch is part of today's\nRust pull request\n. Besides the documentation update, that patch also adds the \"__rust_helper\" annotation for\nimproving Rust kernel builds with kernel LTO usage\n. There are also various enhancements to the Rust kernel crates but nothing too incredibly noteworthy at large.\n51 Comments",

      "content_full": "Intel Recently Shelved Numerous Open-Source Projects\nWritten by\nMichael Larabel\nin\nIntel\non 8 February 2026 at 02:06 PM EST.\n21 Comments\nAfter discovering this morning that\nIntel archived/discontinued its On Demand \"SDSi\" GitHub project\naround that controversial feature, it was a slippery slope in noticing Intel recently archived around two dozen other open-source projects they previously maintained.\nSince late 2025 there have been numerous GitHub repositories that Intel officially maintained and now are marked as archived with Intel engineers no longer maintaining them. The latest projects now-archived by Intel since December are noted below. Notably, abandoning of these projects all came after last year's unfortunate summary in\nIntel's Open-Source Strategy Is Changing At Odds With The Ethos Of Open-Source\n.\nBesides their recent\ndiscontinuing of the Gaudi user-space code\n,\nending Clear Linux\n, and other open-source setbacks, these latest projects being archived include:\nGPGMM\n- Sunset just this past week was GPGMM as a general purpose GPU memory management library. This C++ library was designed for use by applications and runtimes combined with modern graphics and compute APIs.\nPolite Guard\n- This was a project Intel announced nearly one year ago to the day as\nan NLP language model for classifying text as polite or not\n. Yeah, it doesn't exactly fit Intel's core businesses but was just one of their many open-source contributions amid the AI craze...  Intel hoped Polite Guard usage by customers would \"significantly boost customer satisfaction and loyalty\" for ensuring polite text. This and many of the other projects now-archived were done in mid-December.\nIntel UI Icons\n- Closing up shop at the end of January was Intel UI Icons for conveniently providing Intel's brand icons for easy web embedding.\nOpenVINO Extension for Stable Diffusion\n- Showcasing their OpenVINO AI toolkit -- which they still maintain -- for use Stable Diffusion.\nHiBench\n- An Intel project providing a big data benchmarking suite for Hadoop and similar uses. Intel had maintained HiBench the prior 14 years until it was stopped just before Christmas.\nNode-DC-EIS\n- An effort to provide Data Center Employee Information Services in Node.js for showcasing workloads for Node.js use in the data center with Xeon processors. The project was started a decade ago.\nopen-omics-scanpy\n- Single-cell analysis code in Python that is quite scalable.\nOP-TEE Release Binaries\n- A de facto location for easily having the latest OP-TEE assets for TDX use. There were also other OP-TEE projects discontinued such as the out-of-tree\nOP-TEE Linux driver\nbeing archived too.\nFineIBT Userspace\n- FineIBT user-space prototyping code though in this case that work has largely been upstreamed I believe.\nVCDP linux-kmd\n- Some out-of-tree media driver code.\nPlus a number of other Intel GitHub repositories of lesser importance and for some that were started but never end up saw code being committed.  Most of these GitHub projects weren't really central to Intel's core business but just showcasing interesting use-cases for Xeon CPUs, making their OpenVINO AI toolkit more appealing, etc. So given Intel's difficult headwinds, it's not too surprising they ended these but still unfortunate to see them continuing to take steps away from their former open-source glory in being one of the most significant contributors to the open-source ecosystem as a whole. With their reduction in engineering talent over the past year, many of these projects became unmaintainable or weren't seeing any code commits for months before formally being archived. Again, more details on the unfortunate open-source situation within\nIntel's Open-Source Strategy Is Changing At Odds With The Ethos Of Open-Source\n.\n21 Comments",

This meant IT only became a thing when the dev team already got their own Linux devices with superuser, single shared password for the file shares, etc.\n\nLast year I got the responsibility to streamline IT. I don't have a degree in it but just became the 'sysadmin' because I was the only one taking on ​responsibility and ​answering questions about IT.\n\nI worked diligently with an MSP to get everything in order from backups, redundancy, password policy, password manager, asset management, Intune, CA, standardizing ​on- and off boarding etc.\n\nThis year we came to the point we wanted a clear view on the road ahead so I made a Cyber Roadmap. We identified one major cyber security risk, and that was that ​our​ Linux endpoints are (basically) unmanaged. No endpoint protection, no encryption, full permissions, shared passwords, no patches or updates. And almost no options for managing it, except maybe when using 5+ tools.\n\nLooking​ at alternatives, a Unix OS seem to be a must​ for some AI/ML tools. And we have on prem software​ that only runs on Windows, which some of the developers need in their workflow. So that left me with:\n\n\\- Mac + Azure Virtual Desktop\n\n\\- Windows + WSL\n\nI've been leaving hints about the change that needs to happen and that seemed to have rubbed the wrong way. ​Some of the team members appear to have exagerrated​ this, claiming we want to force them on Windows only.\n\nI got approval for a​ one desk pilot, but even ​setting that up got me some snarky comments​. ​I feel like i'm ​walking on a thin line. Management understands the need for security but also don't want to scare away our valuable dev team (and ​me neither). I still have the green light but feel like it's turning to orange.\n\nWhat would you guys do?",

I didn't watch it because I haven't unpacked my TV yet. Instead, I spent the evening arguing with my stepbrother about DNS, VPNs, and trust on the internet. \n\nHe runs AdGuard on his phone to block ads. His favorite feature is that it fixes up websites so there aren't any ugly grey spots on the website where an ad WOULD be. That freaked me out because that told me that the app can rewrite the DOM in his browser. He informed me that its all good because he hasn't given the permission to iOS to allow Adguard to mange his DNS. And yet! the ads were being overwritten. Curious! \n\nSo I ripped down the adguard iOS app's code from github. It hasn't had any commits in 4 months, which I found weird for an app with millions of users. Digging in a bit further, I learned that the library that adjudicates DNS is actually closed source. I did a tiny bit of lightning triage on the compiled binary itself but nothing suspicious leapt out at me. Because of the nature of the app store, I don't even KNOW that the code on github is the same as the code compiled into the iphone app. \n\nWhile reversing the app and reviewing the code I learned that the way they fix up ads is by executing 20,000+ lines of javascript on EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you load. The javascript is pulled remotely every 6 hours. \n\nI kept digging and learned that Adguard is registered in Cyprus but all the developers live in Moscow. The hostnames from the commit logs are all from workstations with .ru TLDs and every single commit comes with a UTC+0300 (moscow timezone) timezone locale. \n\nI have no evidence that Adguard is up to no good! But loading 20,000+ lines of javascript from a team of developers in moscow and executing it on every single page you load in Safari feels.... worse than ads! Maybe I'm just paranoid. I went as far as ordering a jailbroken iphone on ebay to yoink the app off my phone and reverse engineer the binary itself straight from the horses mouth.\n\nThe point of the story is sometimes our lack of trust in *everyone* results in deeply concentrated trust in *someone* who might live in Moscow. This can make us *feel* better, but can have the opposite effect. \n\nWhat does the braintrust on linkedin think?",

And, I've been working on improving it all that time. I forgot why I even wanted to improve the performance in the first place but to give you some background, I initially got into JSON parsing because I wanted to parse JSONC as I was messing around with config files back then. Existing crates didn't fill my niche.\n\nSo I did what a \"real\" programmer would do. Spend hours writing code to automate something that can be done manully in less than a minute. /s\n\nEnough of the past, but nothing much I can share of the present either. All that I can say is life hasn't been the same since I got into JSON parsing. While trying to improve performance I read about simdjson. Obviously I tried to do what they did. But each time I failed. Heck I didn't even know about how bitwise OPs worked. All that I knew was `flag ^= true` will flip the boolean, that's all.\n\nI also had the misconception of LUT, I thought of it as a golden key to everything. So, I abused it everywhere thinking \"it will eliminate branches and improve performance\", right? I was wrong, loading LUT everywhere will cause cache eviction in CPU. You will benefit from them only if they are hot and is likely to stay in cache for the total duration. I even went ahead to create a diabolical code that stored all functions in LUT lol.\n\nHaving read about simdjson, I again had the misconception that doing branchless operations everywhere will solve everything even if it performs additional instructions significantly. So obviously I went ahead to overcomplicate things trying to do everything in branchless manner. Got depressed for a fair amount of time when I was stuck and unable to understand why It doesn't work. In the end I realized, it is as they \"it depends\". If the code is highly predictable then branch predictors will do it better. Made me appreciate CPUs more.\n\n  \nMoral of the story, whatever you do, it all depends on what you're doing. I had skill issue so I had all these misconceptions （￣︶￣）↗　. To make things clear, I'm not slandering LUT, branch predictors, branchless codes etc. All of them have their own use cases and its upto you on how to use them and properly as well.\n\nI've learnt many things in this journey, my words aren't enough to describe it all. It wouldn't have been possible without the people who were generous enough to share their findings/codes for free in the internet. I will forever be grateful to them!\n\nAnyways, here is the repository [GitHub - cyruspyre/flexon: SIMD accelerated JSON parser](https://github.com/cyruspyre/flexon)",
